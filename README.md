# kg-interview
This repo contains my interview code for `Kingdom Gaming`.
## Brief
- We have an open shop in the SMP spawn, we want to convert this into a shop where you can exchange money for food.
- Put a villager in the shop, when clicked on display menu, with food you can buy for in game money.
## Thoughtprocess
- Using Vault as the economy plugin.
- Open up a Inventory with certain items in it. Possibly with colouring

## Extra features
- Database logging of all transactions; allowing staff to easily spot cheaters.
- Custom items depending on your rank, (eula?)
